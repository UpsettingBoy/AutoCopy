# AutoCopy

### About
---
This small console app was firstly created to sync Terraria local savegames between my **Windows** desktop and my **Windows portable** installation on an external HDD.

This also works kind as a **local backup system**, something I do not recommend due to this program overwrites the folder every time it does a _'backup'_ instead of creating an actual backup.

### Use
---
Personally, I think this app it's pretty straigthforward, but in any case, the program will guide you during the creation of a _copy_ profile.

To initialize this utility, you must have installed .**NET Core**, then run inside the repository:   
```  
dotnet run   
```    
Now the program should execute with no problem.

### License
---
This program is under **MIT** license.      
**AutoCopy** also make use of **NewtonSoft.Json** which also runs under **MIT** license.
